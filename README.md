# Lacey Williams Henschel ([@laceynwilliams](https://twitter.com/laceynwilliams))

My name is Lacey, and my pronouns are she/her. I live in Oregon with my husband, daughter, and two elderly cats. 

I'm a web developer and Django consultant with [REVSYS](https://www.revsys.com/). I'm also a skilled technical writer, coding teacher, workshop mentor, and conference speaker who is passionate about helping complex topics go from "intimidating" to "totally doable" for people of all experience levels. 

From 2015-2020, I was an organizer for [DjangoCon US](https://djangocon.us/). I was conference chair or co-chair for two of those years. I was nominated for the Django Software Foundation's [Malcolm Tredinick Memorial Prize](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2018/jan/22/2017-malcolm-tredinnick-prize-claude-paroz/) in 2017 for my contributions to the Django community.
